# Lane Detection

## Description
A simple Lane Detection algorithm implemented in Python using OpenCV techinques. This repository consists of a Jupyter Notebook that has cell-by-cell code snippets to eventually detect lanes in a given clip that may be recorded from the dashboard of a moving car. The notebook in this repo walks you through each step, comments along the code is self explanatory.  

## Requirements
Jupyter Notebook, Python, OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy and MoviePy

## Usage
1. Clone the repository. </br>
2. Open the directory with Jupyter Notebook and open **[Lane Detection.ipynb]
3. Proceed to run each cell. </br>
